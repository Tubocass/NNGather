QUICK START
------------------------------------------
Hello and thank you for purchasing PolyNav! Here is how to get started quickly!
1. Create your first navigation map through "Tools/ParadoxNotion/PolyNav/Create PolyNav Map".
    - A gameobject with the PolyNavMap component and a PolygonCollider2D will be created.
2. Modify the PolygonCollider2D to shape out the walkable area using the default Unity controls.
3. To create obstacles, you can do so through "Tools/ParadoxNotion/PolyNav/Create Polynav Obstacle".
    - A gameobject with the PolyNavObstacle component and a PolygonCollider2D will be created.
4. Modify the PolygonCollider2D to shape out the obstacle, once again using the default Unity controls.
5. Repeat #3 and #4 as many times as you like to create more obstacles.
6. To make a gameobject use PolyNav pathfinding, add the PolyNavAgent component to it and adjust the parameters as desired.
7. From there on, you can either use the PolyNavAgent API like 'SetDestination' to make the agent move, or use the example "ClickToMove" component included.
8. Remember to open up the DEMO scene included to see all the above in action! (also remember to enable "Gizmos" in the Game View toolbar to see gizmos in playmode!)
9. Please visit https://paradoxnotion.com/polynav for the documentation!
